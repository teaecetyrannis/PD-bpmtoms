# PD-bpmtoms
 Convert bpm to ms!  
 
 This will take a beats per minute value and convert it to the length of one beat expressed in milliseconds (i.e. receives 60 and outputs 1000).  
 The simplest patch ever, but I need to make this operation quite a lot so I just went ahead and made a patch out of it.
